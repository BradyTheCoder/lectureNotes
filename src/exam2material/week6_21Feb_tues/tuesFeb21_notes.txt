HW 4 due Tuesday, February 21

////////////////////////////////////

Today:

- remaining negation rules
- applications to conditional statements
- natural deduction proof strategies
- soundness and completeness

///////////////////////////////////

Bottom-elimination:

         ⊥
⊥e:  ----------
         R


Proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum):

       {¬P assume
        ... ⊥}
pbc:  ----------
          P

///////////////////////////////////


p ∨ q, ¬p ⊢ q


¬¬p ⊢ p


¬q → ¬p ⊢ p → q



¬(¬p ∨ ¬q) ⊢ p ∧ q



////////////////////////////////////

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example:


Law of the excluded middle.

p ∨ ¬p

⊢ p ∨ ¬p



⊢ (theorem that you are trying to prove)

//////////////////////////////////

Example: prove the following theorem:


((p → q) → (¬q → ¬p)) ∧ ((¬q → ¬p) → (p → q))


Where have we seen this? What is another way to prove the same thing?



/////////////////////////////////

How do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises (∧e, →e)
3. Look at what you are trying to prove (find its top level operator)

    ∧ - prove the left and right sides separately, use ∧i to build

    ∨ - do you have an OR statement already? Try OR-elimination.
        can you get just one side? (think of them as separate things)
        then use ∨i. (is there negation involved? maybe try pbc
        if nothing else works. or try ⊥e if you can get a contradiction
        to conclude whatever you want.)

    → - subproof, assume LHS, get to RHS, →i

    ¬ - subproof, assume is true, get ⊥, use ¬i


Inside a subproof, think about what you are trying to prove right then.
Treat it like a separate proof, apply strategies above.

Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above:
- trying to prove just a propositional atom? Negation involved? Try pbc.
- or anytime above strategies don't work out, assume ¬(what you want),
    try to get ⊥, use pbc


Need a contradiction? Look at all information, see where ⊥ could possibly
come from. Prove whatever parts needed to get there.

As a last resort, copy/paste LEM proof to have (something) ∨ ¬(something).
Use OR-elimination on it.

/////////////////////////////////

Putting it all together.

(c ∧ n) → t, h ∧ ¬s, h ∧ ¬(s ∨ c) → p ⊢ (n ∧ ¬t) → p


(p → q) → r, s → ¬p, t, (¬s ∧ t) → q ⊢ r

/////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of propositional logic



SOUNDNESS: everything that is provable is actually true

everything we can prove with natural deduction is
also true in truth tables




COMPLETENESS: everything that is true is provable

everything we can show is true in a truth table
can also be proved with natural deduction




What would it mean to be sound and complete?



//////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic is SOUND, because whenever we use
natural deduction to prove

P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q


we can also use truth tables to show that

whenever P1, P2, ..., Pn are all true, then q is also true


/////////////////////////////

Reasoning idea:

∧e1 rule lets us have p ∧ q ⊢ p



How would we prove this is a truth table?



///


∧i rule lets us have p, q ⊢ p ∧ q



How would we prove this is a truth table?


///


Would need to show this with all proof rules.



What about bottom elimination, ⊥e?

Bottom elimination rule lets us do: ⊥ ⊢ anything



How would this look in a truth table?




////////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic is COMPLETE.


If every time P1, P2, ..., Pn are all true in a truth table,
    then q is also true

...then we can also use natural deduction to prove

    P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q



...idea involves turning each line of a truth table
    into a sequent

relies heavily on LEM



///////////////////////////////////////

Next time:

- a bit with sets, mathematical notation
    (what have you seen?)

- limitations of propositional logic
- predicates and quantifiers
