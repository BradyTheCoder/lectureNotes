HW 6 due tonight

Exam 2 will be Thurs March 9
    - we'll spend some time reviewing today


/////////////////////////////////

Today:
- Prove DeMorgan's laws for quantifiers
- Exam 2 review

/////////////////////////////////

Proving DeMorgan's laws

∀ x ¬P(x)       equivalent to       ¬(∃ x P(x))

∃ x ¬P(x)       equivalent to       ¬(∀ x P(x))

/////////////////////////////////

Exam 2:
- Thursday, March 9 9:30-10:45 Ackert 120
- Closed notes, closed computers
- All "open-ended" problems - similar to HW 4-6

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with negation rules
    - not elimination, not introduction, bottom elimination, and pbc
    - still expected to be familiar with all other rules

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
     - union, intersection, difference, subsets
     - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic (deduction rules with quantifiers)

- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent

///////////////////////////////////

Previous exam

- will post full solution after class
- had a different format than yours will
- had somewhat different content than yours will

I'll work relevant problems now.

///////////////////////////////////

∈ ℤ ∪ ⋂  ≥ ≤ ∀ ∃ ¬

Other review problems:


What are the elements in this set?

{x : x = 5k, k ∈ ℤ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 20}



Use set builder notation to describe the elements in
the set: -89, -79, -69, ..., -9, 1, 11, 21, ..., 91



If A ⋂ B = A ∪ B, then what does A - B = ?



///////////////////////////////////

Predicates:

(Domain: dogs)

P(x): dog x is a spaniel
R(x): dog x is a retriever
F(x): dog x plays fetch
N(x,y): dog x is nice to dog y

"Rover" is an individual dog


∈ ℤ ∪ ⋂  ≥ ≤ ∀ ∃ ¬

How do you write:

Rover plays fetch but is not a retriever.


There is a spaniel who doesn't play fetch.


All retrievers play fetch.


Not all dogs who play fetch are retrievers.


There is a retriever who is nicer than all spaniels.


/////////////////////////////////

Negate the statements:

∃ x (R(x) ^ F(x))



∀ x ∀ y (R(x) -> N(x, y))



///////////////////////////////

Evaluate the statement:

∀ x ∀ y (x < 0 ^ y < 0 -> x - y < 0)
