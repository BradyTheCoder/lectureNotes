////////////////////////////////////////

- where to find examples from class

- how to clone lecture notes repo

- weekly review quizzes

- what to do before each class

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- logic puzzles
- begin logic gates and truth tables

/////////////////////////////////

The puzzles in this lecture are all either from or inspired by:
”What is the Name of This Book?”, by Raymond Smullyan

/////////////////////////////////
The first puzzles involve the island of Knights and Knaves.
Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.

Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.

/////////////////////////////////

Who can say, "I'm a knave"?

knight: nope!
knave: nope!






/////////////////////////////////

You see two inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

What are Ava and Bob?

Suppose Ava is a knight. Then from her statement,
    Bob must be a knave. His statement is a lie
    because HE is a knave (which is good).

Suppose Ava is a knave. Then from her statement,
    Bob is a knight. His statement is a lie
    because Ava is a knave (which isn't allowed
    for a knight).

Ava: knight, Bob: knave




/////////////////////////////////

You see two different inhabitants, Eve and Fred.

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

What are Eve and Fred?

(what does the "or" mean?) - inclusive.

Suppose Eve is a knight. Then Fred must be a knight
    to make her statement true.

Suppose Eve is a knave. Her statement would be true,
    which is not allowed for a knave.

Solution: Eve is a knight, Fred is a knight


////////////////////////////////////

You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, “Bill would tell you that I am a knave.”

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?

How could we rewrite/simplify each statement?

Sarah: Bill is a knight
Bill: Mae is a knight
Mae: Bill would tell you that I am a knave

Suppose Sarah is a knight. Then from her statement, Bill
    must be a knight. Then from his statement, Mae is
    a knight. Bill would tell us that Mae is a knight,
    and Mae would tell the truth about that. This doesn't
    work with her statement.

Suppose Sarah is a knave. Then from her statement, Bill
    must be a knave. Then from his statement, Mae is a knave.
    Bill would lie and say Mae is a knight, and Mae would
    lie about that and say Bill would say she is a knave.
    This works.

Solution: all knaves

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days.”
Unicorn says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days, too.”

What day is it?

Monday: Lion is lying (Sunday was not a lying day), as
    he should be. Unicorn is also lying (nobody lies on Sunday),
    but Unicorn should be telling the truth.

Tuesday: Lion is NOT lying (yesterday WAS a lying day).
    Doesn't work.

Wednesday: Lion is NOT lying (yesterday WAS a lying day).

Thursday: Lion is telling the truth as he should be.
    Unicorn is lying (as he should be).

Friday/Saturday: same idea as Tues/Wed. Yesterday
    WAS one of Unicorn's lying days, but Unicorn should be lying.

Sunday: Lion is lying (should be telling the truth)

Answer: Thursday






////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

You don’t know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: ”I’m Tweedledum.”
The second one says: ”I’m Tweedledee.”

Which is which? What day is it?

On every day except Sunday, one is lying and one is telling
the truth. On those days they would give the SAME name
(one would be lying, one would be telling the truth).

It must be Sunday. They are who they say they are.





//////////////////////////////////
Another Tweedledee and Tweedledum (same rules).

First twin: Today is Monday or Wednesday
Second twin: Today is Monday or Sunday

What day of the week is it?

inclusive or. Statement is true if one or both parts is true.

can't both be telling the truth, because would both
have to say "or Sunday".

so one is lying, one is telling the truth.

can't be Monday - would BOTH be telling the truth.

can't be an unmentioned day - then no one would be
    telling the truth.

only other possibility is Wednesday. Then first twin tells
    truth, second lies.

//////////////////////////////////
You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don’t know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.

(so one must be lying and one must be telling the truth).

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle.”

The second one says: ”I'm Tweedledee!”

Who gets the rattle?

There are only two cases: Twin 1 truth / twin 2 lies;
    Twin 1 lies / twin 2 truth.


Suppose twin 1 is telling the truth. Then Tweedledee
    owns the rattle. Twin 2 must be lying, so twin 2
    is Tweedledum. Then twin 1 is Tweedledee, and
    they own the rattle.

Suppose twin 1 is lying. Then Tweedledum owns
    the rattle. Twin 2 must be telling the truth,
    so twin 2 is Tweedledee. Then twin 1 must be
    Tweedledum, who owns the rattle.

In both cases, Twin 1 owns the rattle.

Who is who? we don't know.

Based on Shakespeare's ”Merchant of Venice”.

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
One of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: ”The portrait is in this casket.”
Silver casket: ”The portrait is not in this casket.”
Lead casket: ”The portrait is not in the gold casket.”

Where is the portrait?

Consider the three cases.

In gold casket? Gold msg: true, silver msg: true. Too many trues!

In silver casket? Gold msg: false, silver msg: false,
    lead: true. This works - only one true.

In lead casket? Gold msg: false, silver: true, lead: true.
    Too many trues!

In silver casket.

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)

Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

    Could it be May? NO! Albert wouldn't be sure
    Bernard doesn't know (because 19 in May is the only 19,
    and then Bernard WOULD know). Similarly, can't be
    June (there is only one 18, then one in June), and
    then Bernard WOULD know.

    Month is either July or August.



Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."

    Now Bernard knows the day, and knows it is July
    or August.

        July 14, July 16
        August 14, August 15, August 17

        B: 14 - no! otherwise he wouldn't know between
        July 14 and August 14.

        July 16, August 15, August 17

Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."

    It must be July - otherwise ALbert wouldn't know
    between August 15 and 17.



When is Cheryl's birthday? July 16.

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

^ - and (can use a caret ^ )
∨ - or (inclusive or) (can use a capital V)
¬ - not (can use ! or ~ instead)
→ - implies (can use ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)

gates still used to design circuits

why do we care about equivalent circuits
    (especially if one uses fewer gates)?

what about programming?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q | p ^ q
------------
T T |
T F |
F T |
F F |


OR:

p q | p ∨ q
------------
T T |
T F |
F T |
F F |


NOT:

p | ¬p
-------
T |
F |

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q | p → q
------------
T T |
T F |
F T |
F F |

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)

¬(p ^ (q ∨ r))

p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?

/////////////////////////////////////

Next:
