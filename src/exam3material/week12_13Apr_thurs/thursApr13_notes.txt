HW 10 due Tuesday, April 18

Exam 3 is Thursday, April 20
    (I'll post more details soon)

///////////////////////

Today:

- finish recursive function verification
- loop invariants and verifying loops
- "Logika facts" (recursive definitions)

//////////////////////

Reminder:

- What is a function contract?

- What does "requires" mean?

- What does "ensures" mean?

- What can the function do with the precondition?

- What must the function do with the postcondition?

- What must the calling code do with the precondition?

- What can the calling code do with the postcondition?

//////////////////////

SumOdds example (sumOdds_recursive.logika)

Want to get sum of first n odd numbers



First 2 odd numbers?


First 5 odd numbers?



--> How do we find the nth odd number, starting with 1?
    (Hint: 2*n is the nth even number)



- write the code

- write the function contract

- verify it (with some test code)

/////////////////////////////

Validating loops.

while (condition) {
    statements
}


We want to be able to make claims about our program after loop
is done
    ...but we don't know how many times it will execute
    ...or even IF it will execute

//////////////////////////////

Solution: kind of like mathematical induction

Come up with a loop INVARIANT that summarizes the behavior
in a loop

invariant should be true when loop begins
should be STILL true at the end of each iteration

1) Prove the invariant is true before the loop begins

    (what is this like in mathematical induction?)
    base case



2) Assume the invariant is true at the beginning of an iteration.
    Prove the invariant still holds at the end of the iteration.

    (what is this like in mathematical induction?)
    inductive step

/////////////////////////

When loop ends, you know two things:
    1) About the invariant? it is true

    2) About the loop condition? it is false


If your loop is in a function, you can use those two pieces
to prove the postcondition of the function.

(And if you can't, you need to make your invariant stronger.)

/////////////////////////

Loop invariant block: just inside the loop

while (condition) {
    l"""{
        invariant (list the invariant[s])
        modifies (list all variables modified in the loop)
    }"""

    code for the loop
}


/////////////////////////

Example: see code for multiplication with repeated additional using a loop
(mult_loop.logika)

--> should the function contract be different than our recursive implementation?

--> should the test cases/asserts be different?

--> what if the loop condition was "i < y" instead?


///////////////////////

See our factorial function
(factorial_loop.logika)

--> How would we write the function contract?
--> How would we specify what we are trying to return?





/////////////////////////////////

Answer: Logika facts

- allow us to create our own proof rules
- similar to a recursive definition in math


Recursive definition of factorial:

factDef(1) = ?
factDef(n) = ? , if n > 1



Here is the equivalent Logika fact for this definition:

l"""{
    fact
        def factDef(n: Z): Z
            fOne. factDef(1) == 1
            fBig.  ∀x: Z  x > 1 → factDef(x) == factDef(x - 1) * x
}"""


Example: what is factDef(3)?


--> we can now use "factDef(n)" in our function contracts
    would mean n!

--> we can also do:

l"""{
    1. factDef(1) == 1                                      fact fOne
    2. ∀x: Z  x > 1 → factDef(x) == factDef(x - 1) * x      fact fBig
}"""

/////////////////////////////////

Revisit factorial example.

--> Add Logika fact

--> Write function contract

--> Write loop invariant

--> Do verification

Next time:

- finding loop invariants
- verifying nested loops
- Exam 3 review
